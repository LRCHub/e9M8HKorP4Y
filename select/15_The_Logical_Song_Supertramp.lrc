[00:07.96] When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
[00:13.35] A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
[00:18.23] And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily
[00:23.78] Oh joyfully, oh playfully watching me
[00:30.34] But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible
[00:36.10] Logical, oh responsible, practical
[00:40.72] And then they showed me a world where I could be so dependable
[00:46.44] Oh clinical, oh intellectual, cynical
[00:52.78] There are times when all the world's asleep
[00:58.85] The questions run too deep
[01:03.14] For such a simple man
[01:09.13] Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned
[01:14.98] I know it sounds absurd
[01:18.95] Please tell me who I am
[01:30.45] 
[01:28.46] I said, watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical
[01:34.48] A liberal, oh fanatical, criminal
[01:38.72] Won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're acceptable
[01:44.41] Respectable, oh presentable, a vegetable!
[01:49.31] Oh take it, take it, take it, yeah
[02:06.31] 
[02:12.15] But at night, when all the world's asleep
[02:18.86] The questions run so deep
[02:22.73] For such a simple man
[02:28.62] Won't you please (Oh won't you tell me)
[02:30.63] Please tell me what we've learned (Can you hear me)
[02:34.72] I know it sounds absurd (Oh won't you help me)
[02:38.38] Please tell me who I am
[02:44.33] Who I am
[02:48.64] Who I am
[02:52.74] Who I am
[02:56.74] 
[03:13.08] 'Cause I was feeling so logical
[03:28.58] 
[03:20.96] D-d-d-d-d-d-digital
[03:24.59] One, two, three, five
[03:35.09] 
[03:31.14] Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
[03:40.64] 
[03:38.60] Ooh it's getting unbelievable, yeah
