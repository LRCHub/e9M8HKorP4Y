Some people like a cheatin' song
Reminiscin' on a love gone wrong
Some like a slow [?]
Or maybe somethin' kinda old school
Some people like it more upbeat
To get 'em movin', get 'em on their feet
[?] dancin' with a Mary Jane
But not [?]
But everybody loves a drinkin' song
To get you goin' when the week's been long
It goes good with a drink too strong
A glass raised every time it comes on
And everybody in the partyin' crowd
Yeah, they gonna wanna sing it loud
Even if you get the words all wrong
Everybody loves a drinkin' song, that's right
If you're sittin' on a broken heart
A-tippin' back on what's been torn apart
Crank it up on the whole room
Gettin' down like some old blues
And if you're mixin' misery with gin
Or gettin' high with some low friends
Every time the night's about to end [?]
All you gotta do is turn it on
'Cause everybody loves a drinkin' song
To get you goin' when the week's been long
It goes good with a drink too strong
A glass raised every time it comes on
And everybody in the partyin' crowd
Yeah, they gonna wanna sing it loud
And even if you get the words all wrong
Everybody loves a drinkin' song, whey!
Hey!
'Cause everybody loves a drinkin' song
To get you goin' when the week's been long
Goes good with a drink too strong
A glass raised every time it comes on
And everybody in the partyin' crowd
Yeah, they gonna wanna sing it loud
And even if you get the words all wrong
'Cause everybody loves a drinkin' song
'Cause everybody loves a drinkin' song
To get you goin' when the week's been long
It goes good with a drink too strong
A glass raised every time it comes on
And everybody in the partyin' crowd
Yeah, they gonna wanna sing it loud
Even if you get the words all wrong
'Cause everybody loves a drinkin' song, I know I do!
Let the band play on, baby!
