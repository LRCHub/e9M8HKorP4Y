Heave her ho, boys; let her go, boys;
Swing her head round, into the weather,
Heave her ho, boys, let her go, boys
Sailing homeward to Mingulay

What care we though, white the Minch is?
What care we, boys, for windy weather?
When we know that, every inch is
Sailing homeward to Mingulay.

Heave her ho, boys; let her go, boys;
Swing her head round, into the weather,
Heave her ho, boys, let her go, boys
Sailing homeward to Mingulay

Wives are waiting, by the pier head,
Gazing seaward, from the heather;
Bring her round, boys, then we'll anchor
'Ere the sun sets on Mingulay.

Heave her ho, boys; let her go, boys;
Swing her head round, into the weather,
Heave her ho, boys, let her go, boys
Sailing homeward to Mingulay

Ships return now, heavy laden
Mothers holdin' bairns a-cryin'
They'll return, yet, when the sun sets
Sailing homeward to Mingulay

Heave her ho, boys; let her go, boys;
Swing her head round, into the weather,
Heave her ho, boys, let her go, boys
Sailing homeward to Mingulay

Heave her ho, boys; let her go, boys;
Swing her head round, into the weather,
Heave her ho, boys, let her go, boys
Sailing homeward to Mingulay

Heave her ho, boys; let her go, boys;
Swing her head round, into the weather,
Heave her ho, boys, let her go, boys
Sailing homeward to Mingulay
